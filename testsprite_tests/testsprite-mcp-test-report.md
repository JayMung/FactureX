## 2️⃣ Requirement Validation Summary

### Requirement: Authentication & Authorization
- **Description:** User authentication with Supabase, protected routes, permission-based access control, and role management including login, signup, and admin setup.

#### Test TC001
- **Test Name:** User Login Success
- **Test Code:** [TC001_User_Login_Success.py](./TC001_User_Login_Success.py)
- **Test Error:** Login page is empty with no login form or interactive elements. Cannot proceed with login test or verify user authentication and permissions. Task stopped due to missing login form.
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/d10ec713-4e0c-4f9f-98f0-467dec9f253c/dba35fac-f7fc-4260-b09f-7c1cd89177e9
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Analysis / Findings:** The application failed to load properly through the TestSprite tunnel proxy. Multiple resources returned ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE errors, including critical files like App.tsx, Login.tsx, and Vite dependencies. This indicates a proxy/tunnel configuration issue or CSP (Content Security Policy) blocking issue. The login functionality itself exists in the codebase but was inaccessible during testing due to infrastructure problems.
---

#### Test TC002
- **Test Name:** User Login Failure with Invalid Credentials
- **Test Code:** [TC002_User_Login_Failure_with_Invalid_Credentials.py](./TC002_User_Login_Failure_with_Invalid_Credentials.py)
- **Test Error:** Login test cannot be performed because the initial page is empty and no login form or link is available.
- **Test Visualization and Result:** https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/d10ec713-4e0c-4f9f-98f0-467dec9f253c/83cf13aa-2862-46e4-9147-50b1439bcc3c
- **Status:** ❌ Failed
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Analysis / Findings:** Same root cause as TC001. The test could not verify error handling for invalid credentials because the page failed to load. The Login.tsx component includes proper error handling for invalid credentials using Supabase authentication, but testing was blocked by resource loading failures.
---

## 4️⃣ Key Gaps / Risks

### Critical Issues:
1. **Infrastructure Failure - Proxy/Tunnel Configuration**: The primary blocker for 86.7% of test failures is that resources fail to load with ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE errors when accessed through the TestSprite tunnel proxy. This suggests:
   - Content Security Policy (CSP) in index.html may be blocking proxy requests
   - Vite dev server configuration may not be handling proxied requests correctly
   - Network/tunnel configuration between TestSprite and local development server needs adjustment

2. **Security Features Untested**: All role-based access control, permission guards, and row-level security features remain completely unvalidated. This is a **CRITICAL RISK** for a production application handling financial transactions.

3. **Form Validation Untested**: Input validation for clients and transactions (using Zod schemas) could not be verified. This creates **HIGH RISK** for data integrity issues.

### Configuration Issues:
4. **Supabase API Issues**: Multiple tests encountered Supabase authentication errors (400 Bad Request, 429 Rate Limit), indicating potential API configuration or rate limiting issues during automated testing.

5. **WebSocket Connection Failures**: Vite HMR WebSocket connections consistently failed with ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE, though this is less critical as it's a development feature.

6. **Routing Inconsistency**: Test attempted to access /admin route instead of correct /admin-setup route, indicating documentation or route discovery issues.

### Recommendations:
1. **URGENT**: Fix CSP configuration in index.html to allow TestSprite tunnel domain
2. **URGENT**: Update Vite configuration to properly handle proxy requests (check vite.config.ts server settings)
3. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Once infrastructure is fixed, re-run all failed tests to validate security, forms, and business logic
4. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Configure Supabase test environment with higher rate limits for automated testing
5. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Document correct admin setup route and API endpoints for test scripts

### What Worked:
- ✅ Admin setup page loads and functions correctly
- ✅ UI components and responsive design work properly when pages load successfully
- ✅ Application architecture and codebase structure are sound with proper separation of concerns

### Overall Assessment:
Only **13.33%** of tests passed due to infrastructure/configuration issues rather than application bugs. The codebase appears well-structured with comprehensive features including authentication, RBAC, multi-currency transactions, activity logging, and bulk operations. However, **none of these critical business features could be validated** due to resource loading failures. The most urgent action is resolving the proxy/CSP configuration to enable proper end-to-end testing.
