#### Test TC009
- **Test Name:** Transaction Status Workflow Updates
- **Test Code:** [TC009_Transaction_Status_Workflow_Updates.py](./TC009_Transaction_Status_Workflow_Updates.py)
- **Test Error:** The task to verify that transaction status can be updated correctly and relevant client history is updated automatically upon status change could not be fully completed. An admin account was created successfully, but login attempts with the created credentials failed repeatedly with 'Invalid login credentials' errors. Therefore, access to the dashboard and transaction details was not possible, preventing further testing of transaction status updates and client history verification. Task ended with failure to log in and proceed.

#### Test TC013
- **Test Name:** Bulk Operations on Multiple Records
- **Test Code:** [TC013_Bulk_Operations_on_Multiple_Records.py](./TC013_Bulk_Operations_on_Multiple_Records.py)
- **Test Error:** The task to verify bulk operations such as multi-delete and export on selected clients and transactions is not fully completed. The process was blocked at the admin account creation step due to a security delay preventing form submission. All required fields were filled correctly, but the system enforces a wait time before allowing the request. Further progress requires waiting for this delay to expire and successfully creating the admin account to access the dashboard and perform the bulk operations testing.

#### Test TC014
- **Test Name:** CSV Import for Clients and Transactions with Duplicate Detection
- **Test Code:** [TC014_CSV_Import_for_Clients_and_Transactions_with_Duplicate_Detection.py](./TC014_CSV_Import_for_Clients_and_Transactions_with_Duplicate_Detection.py)
- **Test Error:** The task to verify the CSV import tool could not be completed because the initial step of creating the first admin account was blocked by a persistent security delay message requiring a 40-second wait between attempts. This prevented form submission and access to the dashboard where the CSV import tool resides. Therefore, the CSV import tool could not be tested for accepting valid files, detecting duplicates, or generating validation reports. Task incomplete.

#### Test TC015
- **Test Name:** Settings Update and Persistence
- **Test Code:** [TC015_Settings_Update_and_Persistence.py](./TC015_Settings_Update_and_Persistence.py)
- **Test Error:** The test cannot proceed because the admin login is blocked by an unconfirmed email error, and there is no option to confirm or resend the confirmation email. This prevents verifying that administrators can update company info, payment methods, exchange rates, and fees in settings, and that changes persist and affect calculations accordingly.

To proceed with verifying Supabase Row-Level Security and access control policies, the admin email must be confirmed first. Please confirm the admin email via the email confirmation process or manually in the backend/Supabase dashboard. Once confirmed, login can be attempted again to continue testing data access restrictions and permissions enforcement.

#### Test TC018
- **Test Name:** Performance: Pagination and Lazy Loading Verification
- **Test Code:** [TC018_Performance_Pagination_and_Lazy_Loading_Verification.py](./TC018_Performance_Pagination_and_Lazy_Loading_Verification.py)
- **Test Error:** The task to verify that data tables implement pagination and lazy loading for efficient rendering and querying of large datasets could not be fully completed. We successfully created a user account and reached the login page with a confirmation message to verify the email. However, login attempts with the created admin account failed due to invalid credentials, and admin account creation was blocked by form validation and security delays. Therefore, we could not access the dashboard or clients and transactions listing pages to verify pagination and lazy loading functionality. Further access to the dashboard is required to complete the verification of pagination and lazy loading on large datasets.
